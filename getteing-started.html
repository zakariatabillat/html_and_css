            <h2>How to get started</h2> 

            <p>Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with <a href="index.html"   target="_blank">bouldering is surprisingly simple</a>. All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first sessions. No prior experience or complex gear required!</p>
