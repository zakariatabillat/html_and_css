        <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>

                <p>
                    Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small rock
                    formations or artificial rock walls without the use of ropes or harnesses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_climbing"   target="_blank">traditional climbing</a>, bouldering focuses on short but intensive
                    routes called "problems," typically keeping climbers within a safe
                    distance from the ground while they navigate challenging sequences of
                    moves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Experience the perfect blend of <strong>physical challenge and mental
                    puzzle-solving </strong> as you navigate routes close to the ground, with nothing
                    but a crash pad and determination. Bouldering strips climbing down to its
                    purest form, making it both<strong>accessible to beginners and endlessly
                    challenging for experts</strong> .
